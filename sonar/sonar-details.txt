1. Install the sonar server
2. Install Sonar Scanner [Sonar Runner]
3. Set the path of Sonar Scanner (/bin) to Path environment variable
4. Run the sonar scanner from any project's desired directory by giving the command "sonar-runner.bat"

Sonar Url: 
==========
http://localhost:9000

Admin credentials:
===================
username: admin
password: admin

Configuring sonar for maven projects:
=====================================
1. Inorder to configure sonar for maven, make an entry in settings.xml file (F:\ProgramsInstalled\apache-maven-3.3.3-bin\conf)
in the <pluginGroups> tag.

<pluginGroups>
	<pluginGroup>org.sonarsource.scanner.maven</pluginGroup>
</pluginGroups>

2. Create a new profile called sonar in the <profiles> section in the above settins.xml file.
<!-- Sonar Profile -->  
    <profile>
        <id>sonar</id>
        <activation>
            <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
        </activation>
        <properties>
          <!-- Optional Url to serve. Default is http://localhost:9000 -->
          <sonar.host.url>
              http://localhost:9000
          </sonar.host.url>
        </properties>
    </profile>

3. Once the above steps are done, go to your maven projects home directory and run the below command
$ mvn clean install (Good practise. Optional)
$ mvn sonar:sonar

That's it !!!

Quality Profiles:
=================
Quality Profiles are collections of rules to apply during an analysis.
For each language there is a default profile. 
All projects not explicitly assigned to some other profile will be analyzed with the default.

Using "BackUp" Option we can save any Quality Profile. It will be in xml format.
We can later use this quality profile in some other sonar instance and create a new quality profile by uploading the above xml file.
This way we can get the same quality profile in multiple sonar instances.

We can use the "Copy" option to copy existing quality profile to a new one by copying all the rules and then adding our own custom rules.
This way we can use inheritance.


Quality Gate: 
=============
Quality Gate is the set of conditions the project must meet before it can be released into production.
It is possible to set a default Quality Gate, which will be applied to all projects not explicitly assigned to some other gate.
Like Quality Profiles we can copy existing Quality gate to create our own Quality Gate. [Copy Option]
We can create new Quality Gates [Create Option] and add the thresholds.


Conditions:
-----------
Only project measures are checked against thresholds. Sub-projects, directories and files are ignored.

Note:
=====
Admin users can add/modify/delete Quality Profiles and Quality Gates.
Normal users will be able to only 'view' the above.
